# Session Summary – 4 Oct 2025

## Highlights
- Restored backend-aware wiring in `config/composition.py`, supporting Chroma, Qdrant, and Faiss adapters while keeping legacy builder aliases.
- Extended `AppSettings` with vector-store and LLM configuration knobs; updated the ingest CLI to use env-driven defaults and restrict embeddings to E5.
- Hardened the Chroma vector-store adapter with lazy imports, optional text storage control, and mypy-friendly typing.
- Added an ingest CLI parsing test to validate argument defaults without hitting real adapters.
- Tuned pre-commit hooks: ensured Ruff/mypy pass, added numpy to the pytest pre-push hook, and kept coverage enforcement at 75%+.

## Verification
- `python -m pytest -q`  ➜ PASS (coverage ≈ 84.23%).

## Next Steps
- Install missing runtime deps (e.g., chromadb, qdrant-client) before executing real ingestion.
- Consider documenting environment setup (venv creation, pre-commit installation) for new contributors.
